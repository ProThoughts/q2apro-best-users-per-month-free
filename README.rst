====================================
Question2Answer Best Users per Month v1.1
====================================
-----------
Description
-----------
This is a plugin for **Question2Answer** that displays the best users of the current month in a widget and on a separate page

--------
Features
--------
- displays a widget that holds the best users of the current month regarding their stored userpoints
- provides a page for showing best users of previous months, access-URL ``your-q2a-installation.com/bestusers``
- the plugin creates a table "qa_userscores" in your database to store monthly userpoints
- you need to setup a cronjob for file "cronjob.php" that is called the first day of each month, so that monthly userscores get stored
- Before installing the plugin, please think about your point system (>Admin >Points). The points should not change over time, as the plugin stores recent userpoints each month over time. If you change userpoints later on, the userscores shown for the recent month could vary_ a lot.
